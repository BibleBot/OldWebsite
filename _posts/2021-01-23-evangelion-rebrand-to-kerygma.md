As you may or may not have noticed, Evangelion Ltd., founded in Scotland in 2020 following the need for an ascension beyond the scope of BibleBot, announced a rebrand to **Kerygma Digital**. Here's why.  

After the attempts of becoming a non-profit in the United Kingdom fell through, we had to divert elsewhere.  

"We decided to use the opportunity to survey the field beyond the UK, but still be a non-profit." Elliott Pardee, our Executive Director, said in his announcement. "Ultimately, we decided it'd be best to incorporate here in the US." He continues "we've incorporated as a non-profit corp[oration] in Wyoming, US."  

### The story behind the name.
Later on in the announcement, he briefly explains why the name was chosen. "Kerygma (κήρυγμα) is the Greek word for **proclamation**, like to **proclaim the Gospel** (or the _evangelion_, if you will.) We go about doing these things digitally, and thus **Kerygma Digital** is born."  

### A glimpse towards the horizon.
In the most recent meeting, we discussed the [roadmap](https://time.graphics/line/452039) and what 2021 will bring. Despite our recent issues with [the release of BibleBot v9.0.0](https://biblebot.xyz/blog/v9-changes/), we're still decently well on track. There are some exciting new features on its way, like Codename Phuteia, a way to help new believers to find their footing in the faith. I, for one, cannot wait to see them become a reality.

        </header>
    
<p>Last updated: January 22nd, 2021</p>

<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the BibleBot Discord bot (Bot ID 361033318273384449; the "Service") operated by Kerygma Digital Co. ("We" or "Us").</p>

<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service. These Terms include and incorporate the Discord Terms of Service (https://discord.com/terms) and the Discord Privacy Policy (https://discord.com/privacy).</p>

<p><b>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then it is advised that you opt out. Read below for applicable information.</b></p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>The Service primarily allows you to reference Bible verses through inputting a reference and receiving the appropriate result. It additionally allows for user and server preferences in regards to translation used, interface language used, scheduling, and various format settings. The Service also contains commands that are solely for vanity purposes and have no core function outside of a plaintext message (for example, <code>+invite</code>). All commands can be found documented by using <code>+biblebot</code> in a Discord text-based channel where BibleBot has the appropriate permissions.</p>

<p><b>There is no warranty on the Service, meaning that your ability to use the Service can be taken away at any time, for any reason.</b></p>

<h3>User Data</h3>

<p><b>The Service collects the following data as a result of interaction with the bot:</b></p>

- User and Guild (also known as a Discord server) IDs (<a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/reference#snowflakes">a Discord snowflake</a>)<br>
- All applicable preferences of the user and guilds.<br>
- Global server count (i.e. the amount of servers the Service is handling)<br>
- Approximate user count (i.e. the approximate amount of users the Service is handling)<br><br>

<p><b>Additionally, the Service makes a temporary log that is not saved to a file, except in event of a technical error. The Service logs the following information when you interact with the Service:</b></p>

- User, Guild, and Channel IDs (<a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/reference#snowflakes">a Discord snowflake</a>)<br>
- Information relating to the Service itself.<br>
- The message where a command is used or a verse is referenced.<br><br>

<p><b>The Service does not collect or log messages where there is no interaction with the bot. We are bound to the Discord Developer Terms of Service (https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal) and the Discord Developer Policy (https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy).</b></p>

<h3>How is my data used?</h3>

<p>We use your data in the following ways:</p>

- To tailor the Service to provide responses according to the applicable preferences.<br>
- To create analytics of how much a version or language is used in order to operate and improve the Service.<br><br>

<p><b>We do not store user or guild data beyond their preferences. Statistics of certain preferences may be given to a third-party as required by licensing agreements.</b></p>

<h3>How do I opt out of data collection?</h3>

<p>The Service does not store any data that is not strictly provided to the Service. Therefore, the only opt out mechanism is to have the Service ignore you. Please contact us with your user or guild ID, requesting the Service to ignore all future interactions. Alternatively, you can remove the Service from your guild or cease interacting with it.</p>

<p>All opt out requests will be handled with 24-48 hours. <b>Please note that opt out requires keeping your Discord ID in a database to ensure that the Service will not interact with you. If opting out, this is the only data that will remain. This does not qualify as End User Data according to Discord.</b></p>

<h3>Links To Other Web Sites</h3>

<p>The Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Us.</p>

<p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Kerygma Digital Co. shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>

<p><b>Please note that this is solely for hyperlinking to other websites. None of your data is sent to any third-party.</b></p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material We will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

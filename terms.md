        </header>
    
<p>Last updated: October 24th, 2020</p>

<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the BibleBot Discord bot (Bot ID 361033318273384449; the "Service") operated by Evangelion Ltd ("We" or "Us").</p>

<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>

<p><b>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then it is advised that you opt out. Read below for applicable information.</b></p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>The Service primarily allows you to reference Bible verses through inputting a reference and receiving the appropriate result. It additionally allows for user and server preferences in regards to translation used, interface language used, scheduling, and various format settings. The Service also contains commands that are solely for vanity purposes and have no core function outside of a plaintext message (for example, <code>+invite</code>). All commands can be found documented by using <code>+biblebot</code> in a channel where BibleBot has the appropriate permissions.</p>

<p><b>There is no warranty on the Service, meaning that your ability to use the Service can be taken away at any time, for any reason.</b></p>

<h3>User Data</h3>

<p><b>The Service collects the following data as a result of interaction with the bot:</b></p>

- User and Server ("Guild") IDs (<a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/reference#snowflakes">a Discord snowflake</a>)<br>
- Preferences of version, interface language, scheduling channels and times, ignoring brackets, and verse display modes.<br>
- Global server count (i.e. the amount of servers the Service is handling)<br>
- Approximate user count (i.e. the approximate amount of users the Service is handling)<br><br>

<p><b>Additionally, the Service makes a temporary log that is not saved to a file, except in event of a technical error. The Service logs the following information when you interact with the Service:</b></p>

- User, Server, and Channel IDs (<a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/reference#snowflakes">a Discord snowflake</a>)<br>
- The shard used for this interaction.<br>
- The message where a command is used or a verse is referenced.<br><br>

<p><b>The Service does not collect or log messages where there is no interaction with the bot.</b></p>

<h3>How is my data used?</h3>

<p>The Service and Evangelion Ltd use your data in the following ways:</p>

- In order to make the functions cater to your needs (such as using your preferred version or interface language).<br>
- To create analytics of how much a version or language is used in order to improve the Service in the future.<br><br>

<p><b>No user data is handed to third-parties and generally stays on the Service's server unless for the internal usages outlined above.</b></p>

<h3>How do I opt out of data collection?</h3>

<p>Contact us at one of the options provided below, be sure to include your user ID (if you cannot find it, it can be obtained for you).</p>

<p>All opt out requests will be handled with 24-48 hours. <b>Please note that opt out requires keeping your Discord ID in a database to ensure that the bot will not do anything if it receives something from you. If opting out, this is the only data that will remain. This does not qualify as End User Data according to Discord.</b></p>

<h3>Links To Other Web Sites</h3>

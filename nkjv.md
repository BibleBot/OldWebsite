		<p>Hiya!<br><br>Long story short, HarperCollins denied our request for licensing. They haven't told us about any disqualifying factors, sadly. Some of our users have reached out to them in support of our project with favorable results, but nothing substantial at the moment.
<br><br>The NKJV is incredibly important to us as it is to you all, so we certainly aren't giving up on obtaining a license agreement. We can't rush this process all the same.
<br><br>We have reached out to the folks behind the KJ21 translation which seems to try to achieve the same goals as the NKJV. We currently have the KJ21 translation in BibleBot and we're incredibly hopeful that we can reach an agreement to validate that. For the meantime, KJ21 is our recommendation for those who've preferred the NKJV.
<br><br>Sorry for any inconvenience. Be sure to follow our announcements in the support server to be notified whenever we are able to restore the translation.
<br><br>In Christ,
<br>Elliott Pardee (Seraphim)<br>
Executive Director &ndash; Evangelion Ltd.</p>
